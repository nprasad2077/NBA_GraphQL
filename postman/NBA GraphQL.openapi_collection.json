    Welcome to the NBA GraphQL API documentation! The NBA GraphQL API is your
    one-stop solution to fetch detailed and advanced statistics related o NBA
    players. Be it aggregated statistics or deeper, more insightful metrics, the
    NBA GraphQL API has got you covered.


    With our robust and flexible API, you can filter and order results according
    to various  

    criteria such as player name, team, season, and position. Are you interested
    in LeBron James's overall performance, Kobe Bryant's advanced stats, or
    simply want to sort players by their total rebounds? All of this and much
    more is available through our simple yet powerful GraphQL interface.


    Our API features two primary endpoints: `playerTotalsAll`, which provides
    aggregated statistics for players, and `playerAdvancedAll` , which delves
    into deeper, more insightful statistics for analytical purposes. Each of
    these endpoints can be tailored with various filters and ordering functions
    to suit your specific requirements.


    This documentation aims to help you understand each aspect of the NBA
    GraphQL API, from basic operation principles to detailed explanations of
    different queries and fields. Read through detailed usage examples,
    understand each endpoint and its respective functionality, and let's start
    unraveling the vast field of NBA player statistics one query at a time.
