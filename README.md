GrapQL Endpoint for my NBA DB

## Here's a trippy take on the GraphQL and NBA blend: a player, amidst a swirl of colors, dribbles a ball that's a universe in itself, echoing the patterns of GraphQL in a cosmic court. 🌀🏀🌌

## In this cosmic fusion, the GraphQL logo intertwines with the NBA's spirit, creating a surreal basketball extravaganza. Imagine this ball spinning in an otherworldly court, where the game transcends reality. 🌌🏀✨

## New DB Structure

I have decided to make the whole DB relational using unique player "ids" as the PK represented as unique strings for each player. This should solve for "players with identical names" case in the future.

For example, Austin Rivers has a unique ID of "riverau01". Donovan Mitchell has an id of "mitchdo01". LeBron James has an id of "jamesle01".
